## Community meetings

Every month we host a community call in US/EU and ANZ/Asia time zones to showcase new features, review key open issues, and engage in a Q&A. For community calls, anyone from the KubeFleet community can participate, present a topic, or host. All are welcome!

The two meetings will be identical, so if you miss one and the recording isn't out, you can always catch the other one! If you miss both, you can always catch later by watching the recordings below.

### Agenda and topics

We will publish specific agendas for each community meeting as [Issues](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/community/issues) in this community repository.

If you would like to present or discuss something during an upcoming community meeting, please propose the topic as a new Issue. Alternatively, you may use one of our contact channels to propose future agenda topics.

<!--
!!!REMINDER!!!

When adding new scheduled meetings to this list:
* make sure to update the URL for each entry too. The `iso` param should be updated following the `YYYYMMDD` format.
* make sure the suffix is correct for the numeral: `st`, `nd`, `th` so it reads right like `22nd` and not `22th`
-->

<!-- ## Community membership

## How can I get involved?

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions at community engagements or write a blog entry.

If you're looking for something to work on, read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/kubefleet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and then you start by looking for GitHub issues, marked with `good first issue` or the `help wanted` labels:

- [KubeFleet repo](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/kubefleet/issues)
- [Website and documentation repo](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/website/issues)
- [Cookbook repo](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/kubefleet-cookbook/issues)

And, we can always use more testing, have more and improved docs, or just write a blog post on what you have discovered whilst using KubeFleet.
